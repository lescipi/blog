I graduated in Economic and Social Sciences at Bocconi University in 2019. In my thesis, I worked on the statistical interpretation of deep learning models. 

Since 2019, I am a Research Assistant at the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics where I work in Natural Language Processing, a subfield of artificial intelligence. My research focuses on developing machine learning models capable of general linguistic intelligence. I am interested in building computational systems able to continually learn and adapt to new domains. 

First of six children, I am a passionate musician and a statistics enthusiast.
